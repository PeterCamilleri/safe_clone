# SafeClone

This tiny gem implements a version of clone called safe\_clone. In Ruby, if an
attempt is made to clone an immutable data item like a number, an error occurs.
The justification for this uncharacteristic strictness is not at all clear, but
it does mean that the clone operation must be applied with great care.

Unlike the standard clone method, the safe\_clone method does not throw an
exception when sent to un-clonable value objects like 42 or true. These values
simply return themselves. This is correct because those types of objects do
not _need_ to be cloned. Instead of having a fit, the code just works!

On a note about performance, this gem does not just rescue the exceptions
normally generated by clone, it prevents them from occurring and wasting time
in the first place.

Finally, this gem does not monkey patch the behavior of the clone method.
Modifying such a crucial method was considered too risky. Instead, the
safe_clone method is introduced. This is done to reduce the possibility of
breaking existing code that often occurs when monkey patching goes too far.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'safe_clone'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install safe_clone

## Usage

    require 'safe_clone'

then, in those places where regular clone was problematic, use:

    foo = my_object.safe_clone

instead of

    begin
      foo = my_object.clone
    rescue TypeError
      foo = my_object
    end

It is actually pretty easy to determine where safe\_clone needs to be used. It's
those places where the clone method is generating unwanted exceptions.

## Performance
A reasonable question to raise is "How does safe clone compare with just
catching the exception and handling it?" The benchmark sets a a realistic
scenario where an array (whose contents may be varied) is having its
_contents_ cloned. The benchmarking code follows:

```ruby
require "benchmark/ips"
require 'safe_clone'

class Array
  def use_clone
    self.map do |element|
      begin
        element.clone
      rescue TypeError
        element
      end
    end
  end

  def use_safe_clone
    self.map {|element| element.safe_clone }
  end
end

X = ["Test", :test, 43, true, nil, false]

Benchmark.ips do |x|
  x.report("Clone with standard clone method") { X.use_clone }
  x.report("Clone with the safe clone method") { X.use_safe_clone }
  x.compare!
end
```
